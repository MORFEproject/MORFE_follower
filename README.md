# MORFE_follower

This repo implements the method and examples from:
* A. de F. Stabile, A. Vizzaccaro, L. Salles, A. Colombo, A. Frangi and C. TouzÃ©: Reduced-order modelling of parameter-dependent systems with invariant manifolds: application to Hopf bifurcations in follower force problems, International Journal of Nonlinear Mechanics (2025).



To use this code:
- download the folder on your PC and unzip it
- open VSCode and go to 'file -> open folder -> MORFE_follower'
- if julia is installed on your PC and julia extensions are installed in VSCode the "MORFE_follower" should be automatically activated
- otherwise activate the "MORFE_follower" environment to make sure the correct package versions are used during the computation. This can be done via VSCode's built in terminal by using the command "julia --project=."
- run 'launch_script.jl' with the play button in VSCode
